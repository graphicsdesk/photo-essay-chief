  The University on Wednesday announced Nemat “Minouche” Shafik, current director of the London School of Economics and Political Science, as its 20th president, concluding a <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2022/10/05/trustees-hope-to-finish-presidential-search-by-january/">months-long search</a>.

  Jonathan Lavine, CC ’88, chair of the Board of Trustees and co-leader of the Presidential Search Committee, introduced the University to Shafik, describing her brilliance and emphasizing his confidence in Shafik to lead Columbia.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “Simply put, Minouche presented a compelling and exciting view of what 21st-century universities need to do to be the best versions of themselves for generations to come. She saw in Columbia not only the potential to continue to be one of the great 21st-century universities, but actually voiced an obligation to lead the way,” Lavine said.

  University President Lee Bollinger, who has led Columbia for 20 years, announced <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2022/04/14/after-two-decades-as-president-bollinger-to-step-down-in-2023/">last April</a> that he would be stepping down from his post at the end of the 2022-2023 academic year.

            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “When he was inaugurated president in 2002, the Columbia he inherited was a great institution facing an uncertain future,” Shafik said. “Two decades later, the University is vibrant, flourishing and world leading and shaping. Lee did what only the rarest and most capable stewards of institutions do.”

  In her address, Shafik recounted the journey that got her to Columbia—one defined by, as Shafik describes, “an insatiable appetite for learning.” She described the profound influence books had on her development during a childhood otherwise muddled by a lack of stability.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “When you’re always the new kid, in a new town, at a new school, books become your constant friends. They certainly became mine,” she said. “One of my earliest favorites was a book called From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler, by the children’s author E. L. Konigsburg. It follows the stories of the siblings Claudia and James Kincaid as they ran away from home and took refuge in the Metropolitan Museum of Art here in New York. And while I expect to have some stressful days here at Columbia, I hope it doesn’t come to that.”

            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “For me, attracting and retaining the world’s greatest scholars is the foundation on which everything else was built. Great teaching, great research, social impact, reputation, and philanthropy,” she said.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “But I would also argue that what constitutes outstanding scholarship is expanding. The importance of open science, cross border collaborations, making the curriculum more inclusive, the opportunities around research commercialization, the importance of demonstrating impact—all of these have also come to define greatness … because many of the world’s biggest problems, be that climate change or pandemics, require a global perspective and international cooperation and collaboration,” she added.
