  Jonathan Lavine, CC ’88, chair of the Board of Trustees and co-leader of the Presidential Search Committee, introduced the University to Shafik, describing her brilliance and emphasizing his confidence in Shafik to lead Columbia.

            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “Simply put, Minouche presented a compelling and exciting view of what 21st century universities need to do to be the very best versions of themselves for generations to come. She saw in Columbia not only the potential to continue to be one of the great 21st century universities, but actually voiced an obligation to lead the way,” Lavine said.

  University President Lee Bollinger, Law ’71, who has led Columbia for 20 years, announced <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2022/04/14/after-two-decades-as-president-bollinger-to-step-down-in-2023/">last April</a> that he would be stepping down from his post at the end of the 2022-2023 academic year.

  “When he was inaugurated President in 2002, the Columbia he inherited was a great institution facing an uncertain future,” Shafik said. “Two decades later, the university is vibrant, flourishing and world leading and shaping. Lee did what only the rarest and most capable stewards of institutions do.”

  In her address, Shafik recounted the journey that got her to Columbia—one defined by, as Shafik describes, “an insatiable appetite for learning.” The president-elect outlined what she believes characterizes a great institution, emphasizing the importance of Columbia’s commitment to engaging with the nearby community and the rest of the world.

            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “For me, attracting and retaining the world's greatest scholars is the foundation on which everything else was built. Great teaching, great research, social impact, reputation, and philanthropy…But I would also argue that what constitutes outstanding scholarship is expanding. The importance of open science cross border collaborations, making the curriculum more inclusive, the opportunities around research commercialization, the importance of demonstrating impact all of these have also come to define greatness…because many of the world's biggest problems be that climate change or pandemics require a global perspective and international cooperation and collaboration.
